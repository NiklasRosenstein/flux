# Welcome to the Flux documentation!

Flux is a simple and lightweight continuous integration server that responds
to Webhooks that can be triggered by various Git hosting services.

Flux should be deployed over an SSL encrpyted proxy pass server and be used
for internal purposes only since it does not provide mechanisms to prevent
bad code execution.

## Features

* Lightweight and easy to deploy
* Operational on Windows, Linux and Mac OS
* Supports BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab, Gogs, Gitea, GitBucket
* Stop & Restart builds
* View and download build logs and artifacts

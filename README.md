# Flux &ndash; Lightweight private build server

Flux is a simple, [Flask] based build server that responds to Git
push events as triggered by GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Gogs.
While it is cross-platform and can on Windows, Linux and Mac OS,
it does not provide any kind of virtualization or container
management.
